# DSA_Projects

This repository contains a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) projects. Each project is designed to help in understanding important DSA concepts through interactive implementations and visualizations. Whether you're solving puzzles, finding paths, or visualizing algorithms, these projects offer hands-on learning.

## Projects

### 1. Sudoku Solver
An implementation of the backtracking algorithm to solve any given 9x9 Sudoku puzzle. The program can take user input or generate random puzzles to solve.

### 2. Shortest Path Finder
This project implements graph traversal algorithms such as Dijkstra to find the shortest path between two nodes in a weighted graph. It provides a visual representation of the graph and paths.

### 3. Tic Tac Toe
A simple Tic Tac Toe game where you can play against an AI. This ensures the AI always plays optimally.

### 4. N Queens Visualizer
A visual representation of the N Queens problem. The program finds all possible ways to place N queens on an NxN chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other, using backtracking.

### 5. Binary Tree Visualizer
An interactive tool that demonstrates common operations on a binary tree such as insertion, deletion, and different types of traversal (in-order, pre-order, post-order).
